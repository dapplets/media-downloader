# Dapplet Template
## Getting Started
1. Click "Use this template". In the opened page choose "Include all branches". Create your repository and clone local.

2. Change module name from "dapplet-template.dapplet-base.eth" to yours in `package.json` file.

3. Fill in fields in the manifests `package.json` and `dapplet.json`.

4. Change icons to yours in `src/icons` folder. 

The icon `src/icon19.png` is used for the injected button in source code `src/index.ts`.

The icon `src/icon64.png` is used for display in the store of Dapplets. The link to this icon is defined in `dapplet.json` manifest.

5. Edit necessary Dapplet settings in the `config/schema.json` file. 
The default values of settings are defined in `config/default.json` file. 
The schema follows the rules defined in the http://json-schema.org/.
The Dapplet settings UI is generated by [react-jsonschema-form](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/single/).

There are three environments: 
* `dev` - used when a module is loaded from development server;
* `test` - used when a module is loaded from Test Dapplet Registry;
* `prod` - used when a module is loaded from Production Dapplet Registry;

6. You can use another Adapter in your Dapplet. 

Dependencies are defined in the `dependencies` section of the `dapplet.json` file. 

The Twitter adapter is used by default. 

The list of our adapters are available now:
* [`twitter-adapter.dapplet-base.eth`](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-modules/tree/master/packages/twitter-adapter) - site-specific adapter for [Twitter](twitter.com);
* [`instagram-adapter.dapplet-base.eth`](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-modules/tree/master/packages/instagram-adapter) - site-specific adapter for [Instagram](instagram.com);
* [`identity-adapter.dapplet-base.eth`](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-modules/tree/master/packages/identity-adapter) - virtual adapter (interface), which is an abstract of two adapters above;
* [`common-adapter.dapplet-base.eth`](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-modules/tree/master/packages/common-adapter) - viewport adapter is universal adapter which contains generic insertion points and is compatible with any web-sites.

7. Fill in `contextIds` section of the `dapplet.json` file. 

`ContextId` is the identifier of a context to which your module is bound. This is usually the same as the name of an adapter you are using. It may be:
* the name of an adapter you depend on (e.g. `twitter-adapter.dapplet-base.eth`);
* the domain name of a website to which you are creting a dapplet (e.g. `twitter.com`);
* the identifier of a dynamic context (e.g. `twitter.com/1346093004537425927`).

8. Install the Dapplet Extension for you Chrome browser (if not installed). You can find the lastest release [here](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension/releases).

9. Run `npm i` and `npm start` commands to start development.

You will see a message like that:
```
rollup v2.38.3
bundles src/index.ts â†’ lib\index.js...
Current registry address: http://localhost:3001/dapplet.json
created lib\index.js in 783ms

[2021-02-01 13:58:36] waiting for changes...
```

The address `http://localhost:3001/dapplet.json` is link to your dapplet manifest file. Copy it to clipboard.

10. Connect the development server to Dapplet Extension.

Paste URL to Developer tab of Dapplet Extension's popup. You will see your module in the list of development module. Here you can start deployment process.

11. Run dapplet at website.

Go to Dapplets tab of Dapplet Extension's popup and turn on your module.
